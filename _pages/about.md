I’m a Research Consultant at WorldQuant, where I’ve designed and simulate alphas across global markets 🌍. My work focuses on building market-neutral portfolios, optimizing risk-adjusted returns, and ensuring signal robustness through multi-regime analysis and parameter testing 📊.

Before that, I worked as a Software Engineer at Goprac, where I automated systems and integrated AI-driven tools that improved workflows for 36,000+ users ⚡. I also gained experience as a Data Scientist Intern at Celebal Technologies, working on NLP and clustering algorithms 🤖.

Currently, I’m pursuing my MS in Finance-FinTech at Baruch College (Zicklin School of Business), where I combine finance and coding to solve real-world investment problems 💡.

I love applying code to finance and teaching others—my GitHub projects include a LightGBM-powered sector rotation strategy, portfolio optimization tools, and full-stack applications 🚀.
