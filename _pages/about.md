I’m a Research Consultant at WorldQuant, where I design and simulate alphas across global markets 🌍.

Before that, I worked as a Software Engineer at Goprac, where I automated systems and integrated AI-driven tools ⚡.

Currently, I’m pursuing  MS in Finance-FinTech at Baruch College (Zicklin School of Business), where I combine finance and coding to solve real-world investment problems 💡.

I love applying code to finance and teaching others about creating trading strategies. Check out my [projects](/ai-folio/projects/) page for writeups on creating trading strategies and becoming a national finalist in IQC 🚀.

Please feel free to contact me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karmakarakash659/) or via [email](mailto:glazar.karmakarakash659@gmail.com) if you have any questions about my work.
