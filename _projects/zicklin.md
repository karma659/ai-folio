### The Challenge

The case competition challenged us to conceptualize an AI startup in the educational sector, with ethics embedded at every stage of business strategy. Over six weeks, our team explored how AI could bridge the persistent achievement gap in education while ensuring fairness, inclusivity and trust.

## The Idea

We built Edvance, an AI-powered personal tutor designed to replicate the effectiveness of one-on-one tutoring at scale and personalized mentoring. Unlike traditional e-learning tools, Edvance allows learners to customize their AI tutor (appearance, voice, and personality). Receive real-time adaptive feedback aligned with their pace and learning style. Benefit from emotion-aware avatars that recognize stress or confusion and adjust accordingly. Access multilingual support, parental dashboards and offline learning for inclusivity.


Ethical AI by Design ,We positioned Edvance not only as a business but as a human-centered technology, guided by principles of dignity, justice, sustainability and inclusivity.


## Our Journey

From brainstorming to pitching, we transformed a simple idea into a scalable startup concept with a clear roadmap. 
The competition taught me valuable lessons about bridging vision with practicality. The judges — Kenny Cheung, Dennis Hickey, Nizan Geslevich Packin and Danny H. Park — pressed us to think beyond the pitch deck and address questions of scalability, regulatory compliance, and ethical accountability. Through their feedback, I learned that successful EdTech solutions require not only market readiness but also deep trust and inclusivity to truly empower learners.

From this experience, I also discovered the importance of storytelling in strategy. It was not enough to present a strong business model, we had to demonstrate how Edvance could tangibly transform education while safeguarding human dignity. With a growing global market for AI tutoring we designed a revenue model combining affordable B2C subscriptions with larger B2B institutional contracts ensuring both scalability and accessibility.

Competing against teams from Baruch, Fordham and Rutgers, our team proudly secured third place in the finals. More importantly, I gained the experience of defending ideas before senior leaders and learned how to embed ethics as a foundation for innovation. This competition was not just about winning, it was about shaping a vision for responsible AI in education that I carry into my work today.
